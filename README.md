# Introduction
<div align = "justify"> 

The purpose of this research is to design a fuzzy logic feedback controller (FLC)
in order to control a desired tip angle position a rotary flexible joint robotic arm.
The FLC is also employed to dampen the vibration emanated from a rotary flexible
joint robotic arm when reaching a desired tip angle position. The performance of
FLC is tested in simulation and experiment. It is found that the FLC is successfully
designed, applied and tested. The results show that fuzzy logic controller performed
satisfactorily control a desired tip angle position and reduce the oscillations.
